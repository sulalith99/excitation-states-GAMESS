# excitation-states-GAMESS
These two scripts will extract the excitation infromation in the GAMESS .log file from CI calculations in a interactive manner.

* GAMESS-states: extract all the state energies along with their symmetries, occupancy of the state, coefficient percentage and more.
* GAMESS-excitation: extract the total excitation contributions along with their excitation energies, transition dipole moment and more.
* as these are bash scripts, use "chmod +x GAMESS-states" or "chmod +x GAMESS-excitation" to make the script executable and "./GAMESS-states" or "./GAMESS-excitation" to run the scripts.
* feel free to change the script as needed.
