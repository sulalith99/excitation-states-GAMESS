# excitation-states-GAMESS
These two scripts will extract the excitation infromation in the GAMESS .log file from CI calculations in a interactive manner.

* GAMESS-states: Extract all the state energies along with their symmetries, occupancy of the state, coefficient percentage and more.
* GAMESS-excitation: Extract the total excitation contributions along with their excitation energies, transition dipole moment and more.
